## 🚀 How to Use It (Super Easy, We Promise)

### Step 1: Open the Tool

**Visit:** https://jax-bridges-graph.vercel.app

You'll see a beautiful 3D network graph showing all JAX Bridges businesses connected by potential partnerships. It looks like something from a sci-fi movie, but it's real data about YOUR opportunities.

**Pro Tip:** Zoom, pan, and rotate the graph. Each node is a business, each line is a potential partnership. The thicker the line, the stronger the connection!

---

### Step 2: Find Yourself (Or Anyone Else)

**Two ways to do this:**

**Option A: Click on the graph**  
Just click any business node to see their partnerships. The graph will highlight their connections.

**Option B: Use the filter panel (left side)**  
- Filter by industry (Health & Wellness, Technology, Arts & Creative, etc.)
- Filter by relationship type (Vendor, Partner, Referral, Collaboration)
- Filter by confidence level (show only the strongest matches)

**What you're looking for:** Your business name or businesses you want to explore partnerships with.

   - **<-> Bidirectional** = Both businesses benefit equally (🎉 these are GOLD!)
   - **-> One-way** = One side benefits more (still valuable!)

#### 💡 **What You'll See:**

**← WHAT THEY PROVIDE** (What you get from them)
