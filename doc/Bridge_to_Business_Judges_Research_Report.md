Your facilitators focus on high-value conversations while AI handles routine follow-up, matches peer mentors, and tracks participant progress. As you recognize the Seminole 100 and celebrate growth, AI helps you scale impact without scaling overhead.

Picture this: A shopper asks a kiosk 'Where's the barbecue sauce?' and gets instant directions plus a recipe suggestion. Your pharmacy handles 40% fewer routine calls because AI answers 'Is my prescription ready?' automatically. New cashiers get trained faster by an AI assistant that's always available for questions. And your buyers use AI to predict demand, ordering the right amount of strawberries so less spoils. With rebranding to The Winn-Dixie Company and Florida-first focus, AI helps you compete on service without Publix's labor costs.
