**Subject:** AI-Powered JAX Bridges POC: 100+ Partnership Opportunities Mapped in 48hrs

---

Hi [Director's Name],

Quick update from the cohort that connects directly to your JAX AI brand vision:

## What I Built (48-Hour POC)

**Live:** https://jax-bridges-graph.vercel.app

An AI-powered tool using **OpenAI GPT-4o** that automatically maps business relationship opportunities across our entire JAX Bridges cohort.

## The Results

✅ **100+ strategic partnerships identified** across 51 cohort businesses  
✅ **75-85% average confidence scores** on matches  
✅ **Specific collaboration scenarios** with revenue estimates  
✅ **3D interactive visualization** of the entire ecosystem  
✅ **Automated partnership reports** exportable as professional PDFs  

**Real data point:** Average partnership opportunity valued at $1,500-$3,000/month potential revenue for SMBs.

## Why This Matters for JAX

**Immediate Impact:**
- Cohort members now have actionable partnership roadmap instead of guessing
- Accelerates collaboration between JAX SMBs
- Demonstrates AI application to local business growth
- Showcases Jacksonville tech capability

**Bigger Picture Potential:**
- **POC proves the model** - can scale beyond one cohort
- **JAX AI brand showcase** - working AI solving real SMB problems
- **Replicable framework** - could power future cohorts, other accelerators, or regional business networks
- **Data insights** - understanding what makes Jacksonville businesses succeed together

## What Makes This Different

Not a generic networking tool—this uses AI to:
- Analyze business profiles for strategic fit
- Generate **specific** partnership scenarios (not vague suggestions)
- Quantify value potential
- Provide actionable next steps

**Technical credibility:** Production-deployed React app with OpenAI integration, 3D visualization (Three.js), and real-time filtering. Built to scale.

## The Ask

**5 minutes this week** to show you the tool and discuss:
1. Impact potential for current cohort
2. Evolution path for JAX Bridges program
3. How this positions Jacksonville in the AI + SMB growth space

**I'm thinking bigger than one cohort.** This POC proves AI can systematically accelerate business growth in startup ecosystems. That's the JAX AI story we want to tell nationally.

Available [suggest 2-3 specific time slots], or whenever works for you.

## Key Talking Points (If He Responds)

### For the Meeting/Call:

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"Thanks for making time. I'll keep this quick. I built an AI tool that's now helping our cohort members find strategic partnerships. But I think the implications are bigger than one group."

**Demo (2 minutes):**
- Show the 3D graph
- Click on a business
- Show the AI-generated partnership scenarios
- Export a PDF

**Value Prop (1 minute):**
"This took 48 hours to build because the AI does the heavy lifting. Traditional business matchmaking takes consultants weeks or months. We're doing it programmatically with high accuracy."

**Bigger Picture (1.5 minutes):**
"Three opportunities I see:

1. **JAX Bridges Impact** - Quantifiable partnership creation across cohorts
2. **JAX AI Showcase** - Working example of AI solving real SMB problems (not just hype)
3. **Scalable Model** - Framework for accelerators, chambers of commerce, regional economic development

This positions Jacksonville as a leader in AI-powered economic development. Not theoretical—production proof of concept."

**Close:**
"What resonates with you? And what would you want to see evolved to maximize impact?"

### If He Asks About Technical Details:

**Stack:**
- OpenAI GPT-4o for analysis

- Cost to run: Negligible (cloud hosting + API calls)

**ROI for JAX Bridges:**
