# 🚀 Setup Guide - JAX Business Relationship Mapper

Welcome! This guide will help you get the application up and running in minutes.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **OpenAI API Key** ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- **Terminal/Command Line** access

## 🎯 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all required packages including:
- React & Vite (frontend framework & build tool)
- react-force-graph-3d (3D visualization)
- OpenAI SDK (AI analysis)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

### Step 2: Configure OpenAI API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# On Mac/Linux:
cp .env.example .env

# On Windows:
copy .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key-here
```

⚠️ **Important:** Never commit this file to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

### Step 3: Run AI Analysis

This step analyzes the business data and generates relationships:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

**What happens:**
- Reads `data/businesses.csv` (already included with sample data)
- Uses GPT-4 to identify partnership opportunities
- Generates `data/businesses.json` and `data/relationships.json`
- Takes ~5-10 minutes for 27 businesses

**For faster testing**, analyze just 5 businesses:

```bash
npm run analyze:sample
```

### Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000` 🎉

## 🎨 What You'll See

1. **3D Network Graph** - Interactive visualization of all businesses
2. **Sidebar** - Network statistics and filters
3. **Click any node** - View detailed partnership opportunities
4. **Hover connections** - See relationship types and confidence scores

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"

**Solution:** Make sure you created `.env` file with your API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxx
```

### Issue: "Failed to load data"

**Solution:** Run the analysis first:
```bash
npm run analyze
```

### Issue: "Module not found" errors

**Solution:** Reinstall dependencies:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue: Analysis taking too long

**Solution:** Use sample mode to test with fewer businesses:
```bash
npm run analyze:sample
```

### Issue: Rate limit errors from OpenAI

**Solution:** The script has built-in retry logic. If you hit limits:
1. Wait a few minutes
2. The script saves progress, so you can resume
3. Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan

## 📊 Working with Your Own Data

### CSV Format

Your `data/businesses.csv` should have these columns:

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Name | ✅ Yes | Contact person name |
| Company / Brand Name | ✅ Yes | Business name |
| Your Product or Service in one sentence | ✅ Yes | Brief description |
| Business Website | No | Website URL |
| Your Ideal Client / Target Market | ✅ Yes | Target audience |
| Your current need | No | Capital, marketing, etc. |
| Contact EMAIL | ✅ Yes | Contact email |
| Contact Phone | No | Phone number |
| LinkedIn Profile URL | No | LinkedIn URL |

### Steps to Use Your Data

1. **Backup the sample data:**
   ```bash
   cp data/businesses.csv data/businesses-sample.csv
   ```

2. **Replace with your data:**
   - Export your data as CSV
   - Save it as `data/businesses.csv`
   - Ensure column headers match the format above

3. **Run analysis:**
   ```bash
   npm run analyze
   ```

4. **Refresh the app:**
   - The new data will load automatically

## 🚢 Deployment to Vercel

### Option 1: Vercel CLI (Recommended)

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard** (if needed for future enhancements)

### Option 2: GitHub Integration

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project in [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Vercel will auto-detect Vite configuration
4. Deploy! 🎉

**Note:** The analysis script runs locally. For deployment:
- Run analysis locally first
- Commit the generated JSON files
- Deploy the static build

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Better Performance

1. **Limit graph nodes** - Use filters to show only relevant relationships
2. **Increase confidence threshold** - Hide low-confidence matches
3. **Filter by industry** - Focus on specific business types

### Better Analysis Results

1. **Clean your CSV data** - More detailed descriptions = better matches
2. **Be specific about needs** - "Marketing help" vs "Need SEO and content marketing"
3. **Include target market** - Helps AI identify complementary businesses

### Customization

- **Brand colors:** Edit `tailwind.config.js`
- **Graph physics:** Adjust `src/utils/constants.js` → `GRAPH_CONFIG`
- **AI prompts:** Modify `scripts/utils/openai-client.js` → `buildAnalysisPrompt`
